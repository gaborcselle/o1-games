# o1-games

**o1-games** is a version of [Gamesnacks](https://gamesnacks.com/) where every game is written by OpenAI's `o1-preview`. There's a script, `generate_games.py` that allows you to generate more games. Everything in the `page.tsx` files in the game directories was generated by `o1-preview` with no manual edits. Some of the games required reprompting.

You can try out the games at [o1-games.gaborcselle.com](https://o1-games.gaborcselle.com).
